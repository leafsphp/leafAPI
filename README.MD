# Leaf API

Leaf API is a minimal MVC wrapper built on top of Leaf PHP which allows you to build APIs with Leaf, faster and simpler than ever before.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Leaf.

```bash
composer create-project leafs/api <project-name>
```

This will start a new Leaf api project.

## Basic Info

```bash
C:.

This directory structure is a blend of Ruby on Rails and Laravel

To run your Leaf api application, use

```bash
php leaf serve
```
